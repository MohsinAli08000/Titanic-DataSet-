# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Titanic dataset**. The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, such as survival status, age, gender, passenger class, and more. The goal of this project is to analyze key features of the dataset, uncover insights, visualize patterns, and explore potential relationships between different variables, particularly focusing on survival prediction.

## Objective
- Explore and clean the Titanic dataset.
- Visualize key insights from the data, including distributions and correlations.
- Handle missing values and perform feature engineering.
- Analyze how features like gender, passenger class, and age influence survival rates.

## Key Steps in the Analysis:
1. **Data Loading & Initial Exploration:**
   - Load the Titanic dataset and explore its basic structure and statistical properties.
   - Identify missing values and perform an initial check on the dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values by imputing or dropping columns where appropriate.
   - Remove unnecessary columns (e.g., Cabin due to high missing data).

3. **Univariate Analysis:**
   - Visualize the distribution of key numerical variables like age and fare.
   - Examine the distribution of categorical variables like gender, class, and embarkation port.

4. **Bivariate Analysis:**
   - Explore relationships between survival and other features such as gender, class, and age.
   - Create visualizations to better understand the survival rate by different categories.

5. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Identify correlations between numerical features and visualize them using a correlation heatmap.

## Visualizations:
- **Histograms and KDE plots** for numerical variables like Age and Fare.
- **Count plots** to visualize categorical variables like Survival, Sex, Pclass, and Embarked.
- **Correlation heatmap** to understand relationships between numerical variables.
